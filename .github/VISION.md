# VISION

This file's purpose is to help future collaborators and myself know what the goals of this project are.

## LobsterProtect's Purpose
Help people. Those recovering from addictions, those parents who are worried about their kid's social media presence, those who need help being more productive, everyone that needs a site blocker.

As such feature requests that emphasize this project's purpose, will be always considered and possibly implemented.

### Design principles
- Trust.
- Safety.
- Performance.
- Non-Intrusiveness (unless explicitly demanded by the user).

- Regression. You can always can go back to your favorite version.
